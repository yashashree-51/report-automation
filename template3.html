        <h1>OBJECTIVE - Progress Monitoring Report</h1>
        <p>The objective of this report was to ensure that construction tasks were performed according to the plans and specifications of the project by keeping standard timelines as the base in comparison with actual progress on site.</p>

        <!-- Scope of Work Section -->
        <h2>SCOPE OF WORK</h2>
        <p>To carry out construction progress monitoring at the site by taking precise quantity metrics and measurements of the features present at the site using high-quality drone images and Artificial Intelligence algorithms and marking out features that are completed. As per the requirement from the client, this report mainly covers</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Structures - (Module, Module Mounting structures, Rafters, Piling, Auguring, Marking)</li>
            <li>Inverter Blocks - (Inverter)</li>
            <li>Trench - (Trench, Backfilling, Laying)</li>
            <li>Fencing</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Data Acquisition and Post-Processing Section -->
        <h2>Data Acquisition and Post-Processing:</h2>
        <p>A data acquisition team and professional-grade DJI drones equipped with industrial standard cameras were deployed to the construction site. The unmanned aerial vehicle captured high-resolution imagery embedded with accurate GPS coordinates, and all data was shared via a secure cloud-based server. The GIS team converted the high-resolution images to a high-quality orthomosaic layout by stitching the images together. These high-quality images are fed to trained artificial intelligence algorithms to do pixel-level 2D measurements to find the optimal measurement value with the highest possible level of accuracy. For 3D measurements, point clouds were formed to explore height and depth from the high-resolution 2D images. These point cloud data were fed to AI algorithms to explore all of the points related to the feature. All of this information was compiled in a presentable way in the UI portal. This inspection was carried out once per week, and quality reports were made available within 1 day of completion of data acquisition/upload.
